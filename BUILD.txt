The ooberrt (Objective Open BER Run-time) add-on is built and tested using the
following procedures.  The add-on is only supported for Windows and Linux.


=== CREATING OOBERRT ADD-ON KIT ===

The ooberrt kit can be created on any Windows or Linux system containing the
necessary branch or dev ASN1C workspace.  A standard Windows command prompt
or Linux terminal window is sufficient.

1. Begin with a clean copy of the ooberrt directory:

If creating the kit in a branch, do the following:
    a. In Perforce, right click on the ooberrt directory and select "Remove
       from Workspace".
    b. In the terminal window or using Windows Explorer, delete the ooberrt
       directory.
    c. In Perforce, select "Get Latest Revision" to obtain a new clean ooberrt
       directory.

If creating the kit in dev, do the following:
    a. From the dev directory, delete the ooberrt directory.
    b. Clone the ooberrt directory:
        git clone git@github.com:objsys/ooberrt.git

2. Change directory to the ooberrt directory and create the kit:
    perl mkkit.pl

This will create a ooberrt.zip file in the ooberrt directory.

3. Test the kit using the test steps below.

4. Once testing is successful, copy the kit to leda2 at
/media/eday/OSysBackups/sync/kits/asn1api_kits/ooberrt.  Also upload the kit
to the web server at /home/objsys/public_html/products/opensource.


=== TESTING OOBERRT ADD-ON KIT ===

The kit should be tested on both Windows and Linux.

1. Copy the kit to the root directory of an ASN1C installation and unzip the
archive.

2. Build the ooberrt library according to the steps in the ooberrt/README.txt
file.

3. Change directory to the sample/employee directory and use make or nmake to
build the sample.  Confirm the writer and reader are successful.
